#  Installation:  
- Have Melon Loader installed in to Gearblocks then it should have a mods folder.  
- Drag .dll in to your \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GearBlocks\Mods folder  
# Usage:  
Spawn any resizable part as usual, and change the size/dimensions just like normal, the sizing steps should be smaller as well as the limits much more expanded.  <br>

The rest is done for you upon launching the game the mod changes all of the default min, max, and step dimensions as well as their default spawn size.  <br>
Using Unity Explorer to change the values still works a usual.  <br>
You should notice the pictures of the resizable blocks look cursed and if so that means it worked! Thank you! 
Any feedback is welcomed on the Gearblocks Discord as well as the Gearblocks Modding Club Discord <br>

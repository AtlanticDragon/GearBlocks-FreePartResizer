#  Installation:  
- Drag .dll in to your \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GearBlocks\Mods folder

The rest is done for you upon launching the game the mod changes all of the default min, max, and step dimensions as well as their default spawn size.  
Using Unity Explorer to change the values still works a usual. 
You should notice the pictures of the resizable blocks look cursed and if so that means it worked! Thank you!
